4 kinds of finding road algorithm
## BFS
If the cost of edge are same, it can be most efficiet. 
## DFS
Can find the road with the biggest number of node that visited. 
## UCS
When the cost of many different choices are same, then it's efficiency can be very low.   
## A*
The most efficiet way, if minimun road of start to end is not the detour.
